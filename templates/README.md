To start your Phoenix server:

* [localhost:4000/dev/dashboard/](http://localhost:4000/dev/dashboard) for [Phoenix LiveDashboard](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_dashboard)
* [localhost:4001/](http://localhost:4001) for [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/)

Here are some other commands:

* Stop Phoenix endpoint with `bin/stop`
